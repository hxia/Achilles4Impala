Achilles
========
 
Automated Characterization of Health Information at Large-scale Longitudinal Evidence Systems (ACHILLES) - descriptive statistics about a OMOP CDM v4/v5 database

Getting Started
===============
(Please review the [Achilles Wiki](https://github.com/OHDSI/Achilles/wiki/Additional-instructions-for-Linux) for specific details for Linux)

1. Make sure you have your data in the [OMOP CDM v4/v5 format](http://omop.org/cdm).

2. Make sure that you have Java installed. If you don't have Java already intalled on your computed (on most computers it already is installed), go to [java.com](http://java.com) to get the latest version.
   (If you have trouble building with rJava below, be sure on Windows that your Path variable includes the path to jvm.dll (Windows Button --> type "path" --> Edit Environmental Variables --> Edit PATH variable,
   add to end ;C:/Program Files/Java/jre/bin/server) or wherever it is on your system.)

3. in R, use the following commands to install Achilles:

  ```r
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
  install_github("ohdsi/SqlRender")
  install_github("ohdsi/DatabaseConnector")
  install_github("ohdsi/Achilles")
  ```
  
4. To run the Achilles analysis, use the following commands in R:

  ```r
  library(Achilles)
  connectionDetails <- createConnectionDetails(dbms="sql server", server="server.com")
  achillesResults <- achilles(connectionDetails, cdmDatabaseSchema="cdm4_inst", resultsDatabaseSchema="results", sourceName="My Source Name", cdmVersion = "cdm version")
  ```
  "cdm4_inst" cdmDatabaseSchema parmater and "results" resultsDatabaseSchema parameter are the names of the schemas holding the CDM data and target results respectively.
  See the [DatabaseConnector](https://github.com/OHDSI/DatabaseConnector) package for details on settings the connection details for your database, for example by typing
  ```r
  ?createConnectionDetails
  ```
  Currently "sql server", "oracle", "postgresql", and "redshift" are supported as dbms.
  "cdmVersion" can be either 4 or 5.

5. To use [AchillesWeb](https://github.com/OHDSI/AchillesWeb) to explore the Achilles statistics, you must first export the statistics to JSON files:
  ```r
  exportToJson(connectionDetails, cdmDatabaseSchema = "cdm4_inst", resultsDatabaseSchema = "results", outputPath = "c:/myPath/AchillesExport", cdmVersion = "cdm version")
  ```

Getting Started with Docker
===========================
This is an alternative method for running Achilles that does not require R and Java installations, using a Docker container instead.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. Clone this repository with git (`git clone https://github.com/OHDSI/Achilles.git`) and make it your working directory (`cd Achilles`).

3. Copy `env_vars.sample` to `env_vars` and fill in the variable definitions. The `ACHILLES_DB_URI` should be formatted as `<dbms>://<username>:<password>@<host>/<schema>`.

4. Copy `docker-compose.yml.sample` to `docker-compose.yml` and fill in the data output directory.

5. Build the docker image with `docker-compose build`.

6. Run Achilles in the background with `docker-compose run -d achilles`.
